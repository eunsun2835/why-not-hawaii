<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<strong>Aloha!</strong>
This website is like a journal that I write about my 3-week trip to Hawaii. <br>Since it's <u>a series of records</u>, you may feel that this website is rather a place to chatter, than to get useful tips and information :)
Actually, an overseas trip isn't rare for me as I go on a trip to overseas twice a year on average. Thanks to my mom, she definitely has the 'adventure vibe' which encourages me to go out and discover the world beyond.
<p> But, it's probably the very first time in my entire life to go on a long journey like this. IT'S A 3-WEEK trip to Hawaii! Can you believe it?
The fact that I'am already run out of money depresses me, but I'll manage it somehow... How? I dunno...</p><p style="margin-top:30px;">So from head to toe, in this context, from getting the plane tickets to a vibrant 3 week in real Hawaii, I'd definitely like to share with you guys!
As a foreigner, I think it would be a superb opportunity to expose myself to a new environment, so called 'adventure'! Can't be better if you share your thoughts through comment!</p>
